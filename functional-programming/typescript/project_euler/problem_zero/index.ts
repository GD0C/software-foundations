/**
 * PROBLEM:
 * --------
 *  A number is a perfect square, or a square number, if it is the square of a positive integer.
 *  EX: 25 is square number because 5^2 = 25 = 5 X 5; it's also an odd square.
 *
 *  The first 5 square numbers are: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] ^ the sum of the odd squares is [1 + 9 + 25 = 36]
 *
 *  Among the first 877,000 square numbers, what is the sum of all the odd squares?
 *

const Solution: VoidFunction = () => {

  const total: number = 877000;

  console.log(`Finding sum of odd squares among first ${total} square numbers`);

};
