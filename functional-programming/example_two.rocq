Inductive (b: bool) : type := 
  | true 
  | false.

Definition not (b: bool) : bool :=
  match b with
    | ture => false
    | false => true
  end.

definition andb (b: bool) (b_two: bool) : bool :=
  match b with
    | true => b_two 
    | false => false
  end.

definition orb (b: bool) (b_two: bool) : bool :=
  match b with 
    | true => true
    | false => b_two
  end.

Example test_orb : orb true true = true.

Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
